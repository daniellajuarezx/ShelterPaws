Overview: Shelter Paws is a web development project aimed to home sheltered pets. The primary objective is to connect people to their future pets. In this project, users will be able to see the types of dogs and cats available, adopt a pet, and even find useful articles for future pet owners.
Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: This website allows users to find pets by categories like sizes, activity levels, breeds, pattern type, and personalities. Users are able to submit their adoption forms so they can be united with their new pets. The goal is to have the least amount of pets at the shelter so there's a button to adopt or foster. Users are able to buy accessories for their pets and all the money helps sustain the shelter. The home page also includes a google map in case users want to check out the shelter. The footer contains more information on how to get in contact with the shelter, their address, hours, and email. On the navigation bar, when users click adopt, they are taken to a page that contains the adoption form. Some of the fields have requirements, radio buttons and checkboxes are a select one-answer choice. If users aren't ready to adopt they can go to the events to get familiar with the members working for this organization and with the pets that are available. Lastly the resources page contains 9 articles that could be potentially useful to both cat and dog owners
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
